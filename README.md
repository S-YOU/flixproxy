Flixproxy
=========

Flixproxy implements DNS, HTTP and HTTPS/TLS proxies needed for proxying
Netflix connections:

 - DNS proxy with spoofing capability.

 - HTTP proxy which uses the "Host:" header to determine the backend.

 - HTTPS/TLS proxy which uses the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension
   in the ClientHello TLS packet to determine the backend.

You can run this software on a chep VPS in US and get the US version of
Neflix by specifying the Flixproxy VPS IP address as the DNS server address
in your Smart TV, computer, router, DHCP or somewhere else.

This software does not work with devices which do not support Server Name
Indication (SNI) extension in their SSL/TLS client implementation.
